/*
	A ppm is a simple image format.
	It consists of a header with some information about the file to be parsed.
	The rest of the file is a tuple of red(r),green(g), and blue(b) values (you will commonly see 
	abbreviated as RGB.  Other color systems such as Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow may be used by other systems).

	The way OpenGL reads textures, is by taking in an array of character values(that is, integer values 0-255) in a 
	3-tuple(red,green,blue).  Generally OpenGL also likes the dimensions of the image to be in powers of two(32x32, 64x64,etc)
	.
